# Machine Learning With Tensorflow:

### Introduction to Tensorflow:

#### opensource machine Learning Module developed and maintained by Google for implementing Machine learning in Mobile devices, IoT and edge devices.


### Softwares/ IDEs Used:

    Notebook----> Mainly used on this course
    
    Android studio---> Tensorflow lite
    
    web browsers----> Tensorflow JS


#### Understanding the Difference between Machine Learning anf AI.

__Artificial Intelligence__: The effort of automating intellectual tasks normally performed by humans.

All started with simple quiz "Can Computers think?":

    Computers before used to execute predefined set of rules / code---> AI in then days

___Machine Learning__:  Takes output and input and figures out the pattern and not hardcorded rules as AI used to do. Thus ML is the subset of AI.

__Algorithim__ finds out the rules in the ML pattern.

__Neural Networks__: A form of Machine Learning that uses a layered representation of data to execute a stask.

    NN is a subset of Machine Learning.

#### Installing Tensorflow:

### Topics covored:

    Image Classification
    Reinforment Learning
    Data clustering 
    Natural Language processing.

### Intalling tensorflow

    Pip install tensorflow

### Intaling GPU

    pip install tensorflow-gpu

__Restart runtime__ Helps you restart your defined cells

__restart and run all__: helps you run all your code blocks in the cells in sequential order


### importing Tensorflow:

Make sure you are selecting the right version of your tensorflow before executing it.
